## Notes:
- The reason for placing `Secrets/`, `index.php`, and `db_schema.sql` here is to ensure they are easily synced with the `/vagrant` directory in the virtual machine.
- The `db_schema.sql` file should ideally be placed in the `Secrets/` directory and added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control. However, I have kept it as is for easier understanding and demonstration purposes.
